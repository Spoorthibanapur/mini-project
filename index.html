    <h1>Fashion</h1>
    <p>We all have heard,” first impression is the last impression” and despite the controversies surrounding we all tend to follow it. The first 5-8 seconds of screening any person may help us decide whether or not we would connect with them. The way you wear outfits, accessories, jewelry and carry yourself is very important in creating a lasting impact. Fashion not just makes you be sure of yourself but also helps you show yourself as something or someone you wish for yourself
    </p>
    <h1>Fashion helps in bringing out our creative</h1>
    <p>You may not be a fashion designer to be creative. Mix and match, picking designer outfits and wearing things with a certain accessory or jewelry is what brings out our creativity. Creativity in itself is a by product of inspiration, the drive that gets us going for a particular form of art or expression. Fashion also helps in giving you insights to explore your creative self.

    <h1>Fashion is self expression through art</h1>
    <p>Art is the essence of life and it helps in creative expression of self. The more we create art in our appearance the more fashion it becomes. All the things that we put on with a certain amount of creativity makes for a great fashion statement. Art is all about finding your peace and inner strength. The way you dress yourself speaks about your fine taste and love for art</p>
    <h1>Fast fashion</h1>
    <p>Fast fashion is an expression used to refer to the growing popularity of rapidly produced and consumed fashion created to meet fast-changing trends. The rapid speed of this sales technique creates a competitive advantage for the organizations using it. This is because fast fashion can bring products from the ideation phase to the end product in an extremely short period of time.

    <h1>Fast fashion</h1>
    <p>Fashion is inherently a social phenomenon. A person cannot have a fashion by oneself, but for something to be defined as fashion, there needs to be dissemination and followers. This dissemination can take several forms; from the top-down ("trickle-down") to bottom-up ("bubble up"), or transversally across cultures and through viral memes and media.
        Fashion relates to the social and cultural context of an environment. "Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music…like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives." Fashion is not only seen as purely aesthetic; fashion is also a medium for people to create an overall effect and express their opinions and overall art</p>
        <p>Fashion trends come and go; meanwhile a society’s values are established and evolving characteristic to their beliefs and culture. Fashion is just not an ambitious projected image of a reinterpreted good old value to fulfill some function or agenda alike but rather a evocative and refreshing concept worthy enough to be portrayed for society’s appreciation that makes us even more instinctive. In the society, the individual’s appearance is the ticket to transmit non verbal communication signals such as possible cues about his / her social stature, values and lifestyle. Fashion communication has under gone a 360 degree shift in its communicable aspects staring from projecting a basic image of how we look like and how we feel like to expressing our emotional experiences through interactive implements in the dress. The success of the fashion trend lies in the way the society interprets the fashion trend and judges it. Hence the impact is measured by the barometer of social acceptance which in turn is driven by the several motivational forces that underline the people’s values and behavioral traits</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/img 3.jpeg" width="540" length="360"></p>
     <p>Today’s consumer culture is driven by aspirationalism that diminishes the gap between the rich and economically volatile sections when it comes to accepting and adopting a trend. A classical example is, a consumer in China saves her three months salary to purchase a LVMH hand bag. Further It does not stop here as the people’s cash liquidity is extended by the easy provision of personal loans facilitated by both private and nationalized banks alike. This is even extended by few Brands’ initiatives to offer fashion products on a credit basis with easy monthly part payment options</p>
     <h1>Impact of fashion on people</h1>
     <p>Today’s youth ( 15 to 20 years) given their predictable audacity, the tendency to shop, venture out, try, experiment is high, it is they who decide the life time of a fashion trend. In a globalized world well connected by web technologies, geographical distance is no more a constraint to reach and witness the experience. The lines between buying behaviors are no more significant among young people ( youth) indeed blurring out as the common urge is get hooked on to social networks, interact across a wide section of people of with shared interests and get appreciated. In fact even companies hiring potential job seekers are verifying their social networks and appraising them. In this context, the very idea of consumerist model of Top to down approach is hardly relevant. (Douglas & Isherwood, 1996; McCracken, 1990) theories of consumption describe a more complex picture in which fashion does more than signal social position. Rather populist models and trickle across theories help to explain the phenomenon better.
    </p> 
    <p align="center"><img src="img/img 4.jpeg" width="540" height="360"> </p>
 <p> A classical example is the prevalence of their attitude and lifestyle to decide about product purchase rather than merely following the cultural stars and people in lime light or the rich and wealthy people. Today’s world is driven by knowledge and experience providing chance for every individual to experience and appreciates a moment which is no way decided by their monetary status. And the converse is also true that the rich are not the only ones superior in appreciating a taste or value. And knowledge being a common platform where rich and economically vulnerable alike compete on equal terms. In fact the new line is between knowledge ignorant people and people with well equipped knowledge. (Holt 1997a) defines lifestyle as collective pattern of consumption patterns based on shared cultural frameworks that exist in social system. A recent analysis on the consumer consumption behavior by Chaudhuri and Majumdar (2006) only bears more evidence to this phenomenon.</p>
 <p>4. Social agenda of fashion trends In facfilet clothing and fashion are carriers of wide range of ideological meanings. The fashion trends portray a visual culture and style of dressing that models the consumer identity in a specific environment. The social agenda of these fashion trends is to express the consumer’s identity in terms of lifestyle choices and their attitude. The lifestyle choices changes from one period to another period. In other words they suggest the pattern & manner of dressing befitting an occasion that sets forth a standard. these clothing standards are in fact derived from the prevailing social values and their emotional expectations. The Fashion trend entails design focus and details on a garment noticed at different locations of the garment namely collars and necklines, hem lines, waist lines, shoulder line, sleeve lines and hip lines. A sneak peek review of Google fashion trends report. (Www. Thinkwithgoogle.com/ spring-2015-fashion-trends-google) tell us about the status of the trends floated by the fashion clothing articles. There is a steady rise in the consumption of styles like waist trainer, jogger pants, palazzo pants, tulle skirt and midi skirt. While styles like white lace dress, high waisted bikini, romper, shift dress and white jumpsuit have recorded seasonal growth. 
</p>
<p> Not only had they added on a new element of Elegance and natural well being to the contemporary human existence but have demystified few common fabric notions in the society like knitted stretch denim is suitable only for lounges and tulle is appropriate only for elegant party wear or Haute couture.</p>
<p> Be it the kinematic comfort of jogger pants that meets the requirements of frail customer who would like to do away from the heavy trousers that bruises the skin or the very low weight and airy silhouette of tulle skirt or the easy to don and doff jumpsuit have all added on a renewing feature and pepped up the existing look. The agenda of each fashion trend is to enhance the look and feel of the customer. From the user search behavior patterns, it is clearly evident that many fashion trends have bulldozed the issue of class entirely, and instead follow patterns of “personal identity” dictated by psychographic parameters based on age, race, gender, sexuality, leisure activities, and various sub-cultural allegiances. This is a classic example of how contemporary fashion cycles operate differently from purely top-down models

<h1>Impact of fashion on nature</h1>
<p>With escalating demand for textile products, textile mills and their wastewater have been increasing proportionally, causing a major problem of pollution in the world. Many chemicals used in the textile industry cause environmental and health problems. Among the many chemicals in textile wastewater, dyes are considered important pollutants. Worldwide environmental problems associated with the textile industry are typically those associated with water pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent and those because of use of toxic chemicals especially during processing. The effluent is of critical environmental concern since it drastically decreases oxygen concentration due to the presence of hydrosulfides and blocks the passage of light through water body which is detrimental to the water ecosystem.
</p>
<p align="right"><img src="img/img 5 (2).jpeg" width="540" height="360"></p>
<p>Textile effluent is a cause of significant amount of environmental degradation and human illnesses. About 40 % of globally used colorants contain organically bound chlorine, a known carcinogen. Chemicals evaporate into the air we breathe or are absorbed through our skin; they show up as allergic reactions and may cause harm to children even before birth. Due to this chemical pollution, the normal functioning of cells is disturbed and this, in turn, may cause alteration in the physiology and biochemical mechanisms of animals resulting in impairment of important functions like respiration, osmoregulation, reproduction, and even mortality. Heavy metals, present in textile industry effluent, are not biodegradable; hence, they accumulate in primary organs in the body and over time begin to fester, leading to various symptoms of diseases.</p>
<p>Thus, untreated or incompletely treated textile effluent can be harmful to both aquatic and terrestrial life by adversely affecting the natural ecosystem and causing long-term health effects. Environmental hazards and health problems associated with chemicals used in textile industry.

<h1>Sustainable fashion</h1>
<p>Sustainable fashion refers to clothing that designed ,manufactured ,distributed and used in ways that are environmentally friendly.
    Fashion can be made more sustainable in numerous ways-from using organic materials ,using biodegradable dyes,engineering patterns that create zero waste.
    The sheer number of different ways to improve the industry,thought,means that’s shopping “more sustainably” can prove to be overwhelming at first,with a multitude of factors to consider.

    <p>The research objective was to study local traditional wisdom of the art of producing fabric dye from fresh buffalo manure (FBM). Data were collected from rural weaving community cooperative (co-op) members and experts in Thailand’s northeastern Mekong River province of Nakhon Phanom. The study’s Method 1 added buffalo dung water, salt, and a mordant together, which was brought to a boil for 30 minutes. Method 2 added buffalo dung water and salt, which was brought to a boil for 10 minutes, after which a mordant agent was added, then boiled for an additional 30 minutes. There were five different formulas for each method using a different mordant. Results revealed that Method 1 had the best dyeing solution and produced a consistent, commercially usable, washable fabric with three-tone coloring and long-lasting yarn. Method 1 also used a hot dyeing technique in which cotton yarn and FBM were disinfected in a boiling vat while natural odor-reducing additives were added. Moreover, Method 1 consisted of either (1) FBM, salt, and lye, (2) FBM, salt, and muddy water, or (3) only salt added to FBM. These three solutions yielded a material in which testing by the Thailand Textile Institute (THTI) using ISO standards was determined to have a moderate degree of lightfastness, as well as an excellent resistance to color fading after washing. The study is important as it adds a wealth of knowledge to the literature concerning eco-friendly eco-fashion, sustainable products, and economically viable traditional handicraft textile production techniques.

    <p>Sustainable fashion is a recent movement within the fashion industry that aims to reduce textile waste and environmental depletion while increasing ethical treatment of workers; the goal is to slow down the global production and consumption process in order to form an industry that will be more sustainable in the long run. Along with the development of more socially and eco-conscious production and marketing practices, there is still room for the sustainable fashion movement to grow beyond its current scope. With the support of growing information networks and brand transparency consumers will be better equipped than ever before to make more ethical purchasing decisions and to potentially change the face of the current fashion industry</p>
    <h1>Ways to increase sustainable fashion</h1>
    <h2>Sustainable marketing practices</h2>
    <p>Sustainable Marketing Practices Within the fashion industry, there has been a great deal of exploration of the most potent marketing practices to draw potential consumers or even entire demographics towards brands or products. There has been little research, however pertaining to sustainable fashion marketing. Identity marketing is one such facet of global business strategy that aims to create a “connection between consumer identity and the likelihood to subscribe to certain brands” (Bhattacharjee et al, 2014). Recent studies show that often explicit identity-marketing messages are not as effective in connecting a particular brand to a consumer’s identity (Bhattacharjee et al, 2014). Through a comparison of efficacy within message content, the messages that “specifically define identity expression are more likely to reduce purchase likelihood than those that merely suggest a relevance of a product towards the consumer’s particular demographic and lifestyle” (Bhattacharjee et al, 2014).

    <h2>Sustainable manufacturing practices</h2>
    <p>A large and growing number of manufacturers are realizing substantial financial and environmental benefits from sustainable business practices. Sustainable manufacturing is the creation of manufactured products through economically-sound processes that minimize negative environmental impacts while conserving energy and natural resources. Sustainable manufacturing also enhances employee, community and product safety.
        The issue of sustainability in the corporate industry is constantly growing as both corporate managers and academics stress the need to integrate sustainability into corporate strategy to both create competitive advantages and mitigate sustainability problems.
        </p>
    
        <h1>Goal of sustainable fashion</h1>
        <p>The ultimate goal of the sustainable fashion movement is to massively slow down production and consumption of garments on the global scale .
            The key component of sustainable production is the replacement of harmful chemicals with environmentally friendly materials’ as well as the reduction of ‘waste and resource consumption through apparel recycling.
            . In order to fully comprehend the changes that sustainable fashion suggests it is vital to provide a guideline for ethical production and consumption</p>
  <h1>Elements to encourage sustainable fashion</h1>
  <p align="center"><img src="img/img 9.jpeg" width="540" height="360"></p> 
  <p>Three crucial elements are necessary to encourage the growth of sustainable fashion: 
    the first is to ‘shift consumers mindsets from quantity to quality by encouraging people to buy high quality items less often.
     the second is facilitate production that does not exploit natural and human resources to expedite manufacturing speed.
    
     and the third is to use consumption to entail a longer product lifespan from manufacturing to discarding”
